There once was a mystical planet in outer space home to a species known as chill aliens. 
Chill aliens were peaceful and friendly, but violently lashed out when attacked.
Many scientists studied chill aliens, investigating how they drew their energy from a strange blue,
 charged particle filled fluid.
 However, many hunters seek to kill chill aliens as their blood is said to bring peace of mind and quell 
 mental issues.
 One chill alien was Jim, who lived in the small village of relaxation.
 It was a small town so they were rarely visited, but had a secret well in the mountain full of energy 
 fluid, neccessary for life.
